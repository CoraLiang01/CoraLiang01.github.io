<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University[cite: 7], majoring in Management Science and Engineering with a deep passion for academic research in operations management. During my master's study at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, I was ranked first in my class with a GPA of 3.98/4.00 [cite: 12] and was recognized with prestigious awards, including the National Scholarship [cite: 66] and accolades in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling[cite: 67]. I also had the enriching opportunity to study abroad at Cambridge[cite: 52].</p> <p>Throughout my studies, I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. Dongdong Ge and Prof. Chaolin Yang, and have greatly benefited from the invaluable guidance of Prof. Zizhuo Wang and Prof. Ruihao Zhu. My research encompasses various topics, including developing decomposition frameworks for customized supply chain decisions, implementing end-to-end algorithms for intelligent supply chain management, and optimizing omnichannel fulfillment policies. Notably, my first research paper is under review at the INFORMS Journal on Computing, underscoring the computational and practical contributions of my work. As a research assistant at Cornell University [cite: 18], I am also exploring innovative applications of large language models in operations management and developing comprehensive model datasets [cite: 22, 24].</p> <p> Beyond academics, I have embraced teaching assistant roles [cite: 27] and gained industry experience through internships [cite: 60], as well as engaging in entrepreneurship[cite: 53], where I applied my analytical and strategic skills to build and grow a self-started business. I am passionate about my doctoral studies and am eager to further deepen my expertise, contributing to innovative solutions in the field of operations management.</p>
