<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a third-year master's student at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, majoring in Management Science and Engineering with a deep passion for academic research in operations management. I am currently ranked first in my class with a GPA of 3.98/4.00 and have been recognized with prestigious awards, including the National Scholarship and accolades in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I also had the enriching opportunity to study abroad at Cambridge.</p> <p>Throughout my studies, I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. Dongdong Ge and Prof. Chaolin Yang, and have greatly benefited from the invaluable guidance of Prof. Zizhuo Wang and Prof. Ruihao Zhu. My research encompasses various topics, including developing decomposition frameworks for customized supply chain decisions, implementing end-to-end algorithms for intelligent supply chain management, and optimizing omnichannel fulfillment policies. Notably, my first research paper is planning to be submitted to the INFORMS Journal on Computing, underscoring the computational and practical contributions of my work. As a research assistant at Cornell University, I am also exploring innovative applications of large language models in operations management and developing comprehensive model datasets.</p> <p> Beyond academics, I have embraced teaching assistant roles and gained industry experience through internships, as well as engaging in entrepreneurship, where I applied my analytical and strategic skills to build and grow a self-started business. I am passionate about pursuing a PhD degree and am eager to further deepen my expertise, contributing to innovative solutions in the field of operations management.</p>

<li><p>Implemented end-to-end innovative optimization algorithms to solve the demand prediction, inventory management, and replenishment planning in supply chain management.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Developed a multivariate hierarchical time-series structure and MES LSTM model for large-scale demand forecasts, achieving 72% to 97% prediction accuracy and a 10% reduction in RMSE.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed the customized service level, resulting in a 16% reduction in safety stock levels, and ran simulations for soft constraint penalties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>Acceleration Algorithms for Cardinality Constrained Portfolio Optimization, 03.2021-12.2021</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Solved the carnality-constrained mean-variance portfolio optimization problem, which is generally NP-hard. Proposed several heuristic methods, namely, the continuous-relaxation-based method, the l1-norm-based solution, the integer programming-based solution, and the SDP-based solution.</p>
