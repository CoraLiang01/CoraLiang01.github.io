<h2>Projects</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>A Decomposition Acceleration Framework for Third-Party Integrated Decision-Making, 03.2023-Present</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Formulated a third-party logistics company’s integrated decision problem problem as a multi-period mixed-integer program with the objective to minimize total costs under complex coupling constraints.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposed a large-scale acceleration framework incorporating column generation combined with machine learning, the sweeping and column selection techniques for the linear relaxation problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed a specific rounding algorithm to recover the integer optimal solution. Guaranteed a nearoptimal solution within a 1% optimal gap and increased solution speed by 70% compared to the benchmark on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>Joint Acceptance and Fulfillment Policy in an Omni-channel Environment, 01.2022-12.2022</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Proposed a two-stage stochastic decision framework including online acceptance and fulfillment for the omni-channel retailer based on the ”buy-online ship-from-store” pattern.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Derived local and global threshold policies for accepting orders and provide theoretical guarantees including the preservation of quasi-convexity properties of the expected costs in a multi-period setting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Employed the IPA algorithm and utilize the dual information to demonstrate sub-optimal threshold settings and solve the fulfillment problem within polynomial time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>End-to-End Algorithm Implementation for the Full-Link Intelligent Supply Chain., 01.2021-12.2021</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented end-to-end innovative optimization algorithms to solve the demand prediction, inventory management, and replenishment planning in supply chain management.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Developed a multivariate hierarchical time-series structure and MES LSTM model for large-scale demand forecasts, achieving 72% to 97% prediction accuracy and a 10% reduction in RMSE.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed the customized service level resulting in a 16% reduction in safety stock levels and run simulations for soft constraint penalties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li><p>Acceleration Algorithms for Cardinality Constrained Portfolio Optimization, 03.2021-12.2021</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Solved the carnality-constrained mean-variance portfolio optimization problem, which is generally NP-hard. Proposed several heuristic methods, namely, the continuous-relaxation based method the l1 -norm based solution, the integer programming based solution and the SDP based solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluated the efficient and the accuracy of the proposed methods over the commercial MIQP solver on the real-life stock data and the simulated data sets.</p>
</li>
